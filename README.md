This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Welcome to your plant sim!

If you're new here, clone down the repository, and run either `npm install` or `yarn install` at the root of the project. Whichever package bundler you prefer is A-Ok.

To get your server running, type `npm start` or `yarn start`, which will open the root of the app for you on localhost:3000.

Browse around and try to grow some plants without caring for them *too* much!

To run the tests, type `npm test` or `yarn test`.
